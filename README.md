# Phishing Detection System

This is a simple phishing detection system built using Flask and Python. It uses rule-based logic to detect suspicious URLs.

## Project Structure
- `app.py`: Main Flask application file.
- `templates/index.html`: HTML template for the web page.
- `static/style.css`: CSS file for styling the web page.

## How to Run
1. Install Flask: `pip install flask`
2. Run the application: `python app.py`
3. Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`
4. Enter a URL to check if it's phishing or safe.

## Notes
- This is a basic rule-based system and may not detect all phishing attempts.
- For demonstration purposes only.
